# Web Security Lab:Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Mitigation


## Objective

The objective of this lab is to conduct penetration testing on vulnerable web applications
using tools such as BurpSuite, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto. Additionally, this lab aims to identify critical vulnerabilities such as
SQL injection and XSS, and demonstrate proficiency in implementing robust security
controls on Ubuntu VM to mitigate these vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of web applications and web security concepts
* Familiarity with Linux command-line interface
* Installation of BurpSuite, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto on Ubuntu VM

## Materials

* Ubuntu VM
* BurpSuite
* OWASP ZAP
* Nikto
* Vulnerable web applications (e.g., DVWA, Mutillidae, WebGoat)

## Lab Setup
- Set up Ubuntu VM in preferred virtualization platform in this case it will be in Virtual Box
- Install necessary software packages:
                 - BurpSuite: Download from the official website and follow installation instructions
                 - OWASP ZAP: Install using package manager (e.g., apt-get install zaproxy)
                 - Nikto: Install using package manager (e.g., apt-get install nikto)
- Download and deploy vulnerable web applications on the Ubuntu VM

## Lab Procedure

### Part 1: Penetration Testing
1. Launch BurpSuite:
            - Open a terminal window
            - Navigate to the BurpSuite installation directory
            - Execute the command to launch BurpSuite.
2. Configure BurpSuite Proxy:
            - Go to the "Proxy" tab
            - Set up the proxy listener on a desired port (e.g., 8080)
            - Configure web browser to use BurpSuite as a proxy
3. Explore the Vulnerable Web Applications:
            - Open a web browser and access the vulnerable web application
            - Navigate through different pages and functionalities to understand the application's behavior
4. Conduct Manual Testing:
            - Intercept HTTP requests using BurpSuite Proxy
            - Manipulate parameters and payloads to identify potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS
            - Document findings and observations
5. Utilize Automated Scanning:
            - Utilize BurpSuite's automated scanning features to identify common vulnerabilities
            - Analyze scan results and prioritize identified issues based on severity
6. Repeat Steps 1-5 with OWASP ZAP:
            - Launch OWASP ZAP
            - Configure the proxy settings similar to BurpSuite
            - Explore the vulnerable web applications
            - Conduct manual testing and automated scanning
            - Compare findings with BurpSuite results
7. Repeat Steps 1-5 with Nikto
            - Launch Nikto from the terminal
            - Run Nikto against the vulnerable web applications
            - Analyze Nikto's scan results and identify potential vulnerabilities
### Part 2: Vulnerability Mitigation
1. Identify Critical Vulnerabilities:
            - Review the findings from penetration testing tools
            - Identify critical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS
2. Implement Security Controls:
- Access the Ubuntu VM hosting the vulnerable web application
- Implement security controls to mitigate identified vulnerabilities
            - For SQL injection: Validate input, use parameterized queries, and employ proper sanitization techniques
            - For XSS: Implement output encoding, use secure HTTP headers, and sanitize user input
3. Verify Mitigation Measures:
            - Re-run penetration tests using BurpSuite, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto to verify the effectiveness of implemented security controls
            - Ensure that critical vulnerabilities are no longer exploitable
            - Document the steps taken to mitigate vulnerabilities and the results of verification

## Conclusion

In this lab, I conducted penetration testing on vulnerable web applications using tools such as BurpSuite, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto. 
I identified critical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS and implemented robust security controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities on Ubuntu VM. 
This lab demonstrates proficiency in web application security testing and mitigation techniques.
