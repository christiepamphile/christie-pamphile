# Secure Code Review Lab: Establishing Secure Code Review Process


## Objective

The objective of this lab is to establish a secure code review process within Ubuntu VM to identify and remedy security flaws, including injection attacks and authentication vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, PHP).
* Familiarity with Linux command-line interface.
* Installation of code review tools such as SonarQube or Checkmarx on Ubuntu VM

## Materials

* Ubuntu VM
* SonarQube or Checkmarx (or any other code review tool of choice)
* Sample vulnerable code or applications for review (e.g., intentionally vulnerable web applications)

## Lab Setup
- Set up Ubuntu VM on your preferred virtualization platform
- Install necessary software packages:
                - SonarQube: Download from the official website and follow installation instructions
                - Checkmarx: Download from the official website and follow installation instructions
- Prepare sample vulnerable code or applications for review

## Lab Procedure

### Part 1: Setup Code Environment
1. Launch Ubuntu VM:
            - Open a terminal window on the Ubuntu VM
2. Install Code Review Tool:
            - Follow the installation instructions provided by the code review tool (SonarQube or Checkmarx)
            - Ensure the tool is properly configured and accessible through a web browser
3. Configure Code Review Tool:
            - Set up projects or repositories to be scanned for security vulnerabilities
            - Configure scan settings according to the type of code being reviewed (e.g., language-specific settings, scanning depth)
### Part 2: Conduct Code Review
1. Select Code for Review:
            - Choose a sample vulnerable code or application for review
            - Ensure the code or application contains common security flaws such as injection attacks and authentication vulnerabilities
2. Initiate Code Scan:
            - Upload the selected code or application to the code review tool
            - Trigger a code scan to analyze for security vulnerabilities
3. Review Scan Results:
            - Analyze the scan results generated by the code review tool
            - Identify security flaws including injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) and authentication vulnerabilities (e.g., weak password storage, lack of session management)
4. Prioritize Findings:
            - Prioritize identified vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact on the application's security
### Part 3: Remediate Security Flaws
1. Understand Vulnerabilities:
            - Review detailed descriptions and recommendations provided by the code review tool for each identified vulnerability
            - Understand the root causes and potential impact of each security flaw
2. Apply Fixes:
            - Implement fixes to remediate identified security flaws
            - Utilize best practices and secure coding guidelines to address vulnerabilities (e.g., parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, strong password hashing for authentication)
3. Re-scan Code:
            - Upload the modified code or application to the code review tool
            - Trigger another code scan to verify that the implemented fixes have successfully remediated the vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

In this lab, I established a secure code review process within Ubuntu VM to identify and remediate security flaws, including injection attacks and authentication vulnerabilities.
 By leveraging code review tools and following secure coding practices, I ensure the development of secure software applications. 
 This lab demonstrates proficiency in identifying and mitigating security risks through code review processes
